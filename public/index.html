      <p>In 2017, Delaware Online began to log every shooting that is reported in the state, as there was and continues to be no public database of these acts of violence. Since our tracking began, there have been more than 1,100 shootings.</p>

      <p>The data comes from our reporting and police statements. The amount of information released for each victim varies, as does the information released on shooting incidents and how quickly it reaches the public. This database is meant to serve as a public tool for measuring violence throughout the state and trends occurring in our communities. Police are not meant to be the only source though, and Delaware Online is committed to verifying information and getting out into the communities in which this violence occurs.</p>

      <p>Police do not typically release the names of nonfatal shooting victims. The identities of homicide victims are usually made public, but there are a few incidents where this is not the case. Delaware Online is determined to tell the stories of these victims and what happened in their lives beyond this violence. If youâ€™ve got feedback or would like to talk more about our criminal justice strategy, reach out to Brittany Horn, regional editor for crime and social justice, at <a href="mailto:bhorn@delawareonline.com">bhorn@delawareonline.com</a>.</p>
